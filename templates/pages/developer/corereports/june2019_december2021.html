<h1>Core Team Report: June 2019 - December 2021<i class="fas fa-comments"></i></h1>

<p>
  This is a high level report of the activities of the
  <a href="/developer/core">PostgreSQL Core Team</a> during the period of June
  2019 to December 2021. While we aim for full transparency, some activities
  may be kept confidential for privacy and other reasons.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Creation of a Contributors Committee</strong></p>
    <p>
      The Contributors Committee was set up to create guidelines for how to
      measure contributions to the PostgreSQL Project. Periodically, this
      committee evaluates contributor status in the community and recognizes new
      contributors and major contributors to the project.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Recognized PostgreSQL User Group (PUG) Guidelines</strong></p>
    <p>
      The <a href="/about/policies/user-groups/">Recognized PostgreSQL User Group (PUG) guidelines</a>
      were established to provide a framework for creating a consistent local
      user group experience for PostgreSQL meetups. These guidelines were also
      incorporated into the revised
      <a href="/about/policies/trademarks/">PostgreSQL Trademark Policy</a>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Revised Trademark Policy</strong></p>
    <p>
      The Core Team has previously delegated management of the PostgreSQL
      trademarks to the <a href="https://www.postgres.ca/">PostgreSQL Community Association of Canada</a>
      (PGCAC). Through the advice of legal counsel, the PostgreSQL Core Team
      accepted revisions to the <a href="/about/policies/trademarks/">PostgreSQL Trademark Policy</a>.
      The Core Team worked with PGCAC to ensure the trademark policy would
      continue to be fair and open while providing additional protections to the
      PostgreSQL trademarks.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Planet PostgreSQL Policy Revisions</strong></p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://planet.postgresql.org">Planet PostgreSQL</a> provides a
      means for people to syndicate blogs on topics around PostgreSQL. The
      Planet PostgreSQL moderation team proposed
      <a href="/about/policies/planet-postgresql/">revisions to the policy</a> to
      allow for blogs to contain video content under certain conditions. After
      some discussion, the Core Team chose to accept the policy revisions.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Revisions to Community Conference Guidelines</strong></p>
    <p>
      The <a href="/about/policies/conferences/">Community Conference guidelines</a>
      provide a framework for creating a consistent experience across PostgreSQL
      conferences. After several years of events following the initial
      guidelines, the Core Team incorporated feedback from the events and,
      working with several conference organizers, amended the guidelines.
      Changes include guidelines around the organizing committee and specific
      requirements around the use of a code of conduct.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Trademark Dispute</strong></p>
    <p>
      The PostgreSQL Core Team, working with the
      <a href="https://www.postgres.ca/">PostgreSQL Community Association of Canada</a>
      and <a href="https://www.postgresql.eu/">PostgreSQL Europe</a>, have been
      engaged in a trademark dispute with a 3rd party organization. The Core
      Team <a href="/about/news/trademark-actions-against-the-postgresql-community-2302/">published a summary of the dispute</a>.
      This matter is still ongoing at the time of this report.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Code of Conduct and Code of Conduct Committee</strong></p>
    <p>
      The PostgreSQL Core Team accepted several changes to the
      <a href="/about/policies/coc/">Code of Conduct</a>, particularly around
      committee selection and transition.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>New Core Team Members</strong></p>
    <p>
      The <a href="/developer/core">PostgreSQL Core Team</a> welcomed Andres
      Freund and Jonathan Katz to the Core Team.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Revisions to Committers</strong></p>
    <p>
      Following the guidance of existing <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Committers">PostgreSQL Committers</a>,
      the PostgreSQL Core Team welcomed several new committers to the Project,
      including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Daniel Gustafsson</li>
      <li>John Naylor</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <p>
    Due to inactivity within the project, the Core Team also revoked the commit
    bits from several previous committers.
  </p>
</ul>
